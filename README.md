# Hello there! Frederik Zorn

I'm a hobby software dev <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30"> from Pluto. Sorry was dreaming. I'm sadly still on earth!

- &#128301; Currently just experimenting with a few side projects.
- &#128218; I also have a semi active blog on ma site <https://zorrn.net>.
- &#128238; How to reach me: Look here, don't want to update on multiple places. <https://zorrn.net>

More info here [&#127760;](https://www.zorrn.net). I hope. Maybe. Who knows. I don't. Do you?
